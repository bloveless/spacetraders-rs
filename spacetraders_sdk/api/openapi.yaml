    SpaceTraders is an open-universe game and learning platform that offers a set of HTTP endpoints to control a fleet of ships and explore a multiplayer universe.

    The API is documented using [OpenAPI](https://github.com/SpaceTradersAPI/api-docs). You can send your first request right here in your browser to check the status of the game server.

    ```json http
    {
      "method": "GET",
      "url": "https://api.spacetraders.io/v2",
    }
    ```

    Unlike a traditional game, SpaceTraders does not have a first-party client or app to play the game. Instead, you can use the API to build your own client, write a script to automate your ships, or try an app built by the community.

    We have a [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/jh6zurdWk5) where you can share your projects, ask questions, and get help from other players.

        Creates a new agent and ties it to a temporary Account.

        The agent symbol is a 3-14 character string that will represent your agent. This symbol will prefix the symbol of every ship you own. Agent symbols will be cast to all uppercase characters.

        A new agent will be granted an authorization token, a contract with their starting faction, a command ship with a jump drive, and one hundred thousand credits.

        > #### Keep your token safe and secure
        >
        > Save your token during the alpha phase. There is no way to regenerate this token without starting a new agent. In the future you will be able to generate and manage your tokens from the SpaceTraders website.

        You can accept your contract using the `/my/contracts/{contractId}/accept` endpoint. You will want to navigate your command ship to a nearby asteroid field and execute the `/my/ships/{shipSymbol}/extract` endpoint to mine various types of ores and minerals.

        Return to the contract destination and execute the `/my/ships/{shipSymbol}/deliver` endpoint to deposit goods into the contract.

        When your contract is fulfilled, you can call `/my/contracts/{contractId}/fulfill` to retrieve payment.
