## Overview

SpaceTraders is an open-universe game and learning platform that offers a set of HTTP endpoints to control a fleet of ships and explore a multiplayer universe.

The API is documented using [OpenAPI](https://github.com/SpaceTradersAPI/api-docs) and Stoplight Studio. You can send requests directly from Stoplight Studio or use the [interactive documentation](https://docs.spacetraders.io/quickstart/new-game) to try out the API.

Unlike a traditional game, SpaceTraders does not have a first-party client or app to play the game. Instead, you can use the API to build your own client, write a script to automate your ships, or try an app built by the community.

We have a [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/jh6zurdWk5) where you can share your projects, ask questions, and get help from other players.

## Gameplay

The goal of the game is to manage a fleet of ships as you explore the universe and try to turn a profit. You can trade goods across systems, mine asteroids for valuable ores, or take on faction contracts to earn credits and reputation.

All players operate in the same universe, so you can compete with others to earn the most credits or chart the most systems. The game is currently in alpha, and we plan to add player-vs-player combat, bounty hunting, and more.

## Roadmap

We plan to work toward the following features and capabilities. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please share them in our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/jh6zurdWk5).

- scavenge derelict ships for valuable cargo and spare parts
- create webhooks to receive notifications when events occur in the game
- search for ancient artifacts on distant planets to sell for profit
- send envoys to meet new factions and generate contracts or unique trade deals
- private game worlds deployed on a separate server for testing or playing with friends
- take on bounties to earn credits or pirate other players trade routes
- a GraphQL API for querying systems and waypoints
- deploy envoys to track rumors and generate contracts

## Next steps

The SpaceTraders API is an excellent platform to learn a new programming language, test a new framework, or stretch your skills in a fun and meaningful way.

If you are new to SpaceTraders, you should try our interactive [quickstart guide](https://docs.spacetraders.io/quickstart/new-game) which will walk you through basic API requests in just a few minutes.

If you're looking for some project inspiration, here are some ideas to get you started:

- create a script to mine asteroids and automate trade routes
- build a web or mobile app to manage your fleet of ships
- track and share market price data with other players
- generate an SDK from the OpenAPI spec and publish it
- create a Discord bot for others players to use
